# Driftcast Demo Script (Approx. 2.5 Minutes)

**0:00 Title Card (3 seconds)**  
"Welcome to Driftcast — our synthetic forecast of plastic drift across the North Atlantic."

**0:03 Scenario Intro**  
"We initialize thousands of particles from river mouths, shipping lanes, and coastal leakages. Colors mark their origin: gold for rivers, teal for shipping, coral for diffuse coastlines."

**0:20 Physics Highlight**  
"Each particle feels the pull of twin gyres, seasonal winds, and Stokes drift. We add a realistic random walk to emulate unresolved turbulence and let particles beach—or re-float—along coastlines."

**0:45 Crowdsourced Hook**  
"Future contributors can snap a photo, geotag it, and submit through our JSON schema. Every observation lands in a normalized Parquet archive ready for QA and assimilation."

**1:05 Hotspots and Data Products**  
"Density heatmaps pulse beneath the particles, flagging hotspots for cleanup or policy intervention. Every run exports NetCDF/Zarr, summary metrics, and notebooks for exploration."

**1:40 Scaling Story**  
"Need ensembles? Driftcast runs parameter sweeps on Dask, scaling from laptops to cloud clusters. Swap in HYCOM or ERA5 fields, rerun, and compare sensitivities with a single command."

**2:05 Call to Action**  
"We're ready to plug in live data, expand to 3-D physics, and power community dashboards. Partner with us to turn synthetic demos into operational plastics intelligence."

**2:20 Closing Credits (6 seconds)**  
"Developed by the Oceans Four Driftcast team for the Illinois Tech Grainger Computing Innovation Prize."
